# DD2360-Project
Code for the Project in DD2360 Applied GPU Programming.

The goal is to design, implement and optimize a code for the direct N-body simulation and visualization of a system with double-shell particles and different kind of interactions using GPUs. We will solve it using OpenGL combined with CUDA.
